            A Journey through the mushroom forest came  <br>
             about while exploring the eureka moments <br>
             that I have had and how dreams are <br>
              perfectly alignedwith reality. As man <br>
               journeys through life, there are uncommon <br>
                moments that appear almost unreal, where <br>
                 nothing matters other than the moment. <br>
